You tapped it.\n\nThe screen flashed white—and in an instant, you were swallowed by blinding light.\nCrashing waves roared in your ears. The salty breeze stung your nose.\nWhen you opened your eyes, your feet were in the sand. A bustling harbor town stretched before you.\n\nThe phone in your pocket vibrated. A calm voice came from the screen.\nIt was the AI app, Nagi.\n\n\"Welcome, {player_name}. Please remain calm. You are now in Nagasaki… in the year 1867. Just before Japan’s world would change forever.”\n\nBefore you could even process the shock, Nagi continued with a gentle tone.\n\n“This era is called Bakumatsu—a time of upheaval. The Tokugawa Shogunate is weakening, and powerful regional domains are beginning to act independently.”\n\nYou glance around. People in traditional kimonos pass by, along with the occasional foreigner.\nThe city hums with restless energy.\n\n“Nagasaki is a key trading port between Japan and the outside world. One group, in particular, draws attention here: the Kaientai, or Maritime Support Fleet. Their leader? A man named Ryoma Sakamoto—a trader, a visionary… and in the future, a national hero.”\n\n“Sakamoto Ryoma… I’ve heard that name…”\n\nNagi nods on the screen.\n\n“In modern Japan, he’s hailed as the hero who changed a nation. But in reality, historical records portray him more modestly—as a sociable, business-savvy man with grand ambitions.”\n\nSuddenly, a booming voice rings out by a docked ship.\n\n“Hey! You there—new guy! Give us a hand!”\n\nIt seems someone mistook you for a laborer.\n\nYour phone buzzes again. Nagi whispers:\n\n“Why not go along with it for now? This small moment might change your fate.”",

As you work, Nagi’s voice gently whispers in your ear.\n\n“A wise choice, {player_name}. In this world, acting earnestly is the fastest way to earn people’s trust.”\n\nBy the time you finish carrying the cargo, the men’s tone softens. One claps you on the shoulder with a grin, saying, “You’re a good one, huh?”\nFeeling someone’s gaze, you look up—and see a man standing confidently on the ship, radiating quiet authority and wearing a warm smile. Could this be the Ryoma Sakamoto Nagi mentioned?\n\nWith a friendly nod, the man calls down to you:\n“Haven’t seen you before. What’s your name?”\n\nIn the chaos of this busy port town, a small but fateful bond quietly begins to form.",

      "story": "Nagi’s gentle voice echoed beside your ear.\n“The Kaientai is a trading and maritime organization founded by Ryoma Sakamoto. It was a revolutionary force for its time—independent from the Tokugawa Shogunate, the Satsuma Domain, and the Choshu Domain. Some called it a ‘flagbearer of a new era.’”\n\nAt the heart of the Kaientai was a steamship called Irohamaru. Nagi continued her explanation.\n“The Irohamaru was one of the few steam-powered ships in Japan at the time. It became a symbol of the Kaientai and a source of pride for Ryoma and his comrades. In fact, it would later be involved in the Irohamaru Incident—the first maritime compensation negotiation in Japanese history.”\n\nJust then, one of the crew shouted mid-task.\n“Ryoma! What about the cargo on the Irohamaru? People say it might collide with a Kishu Domain ship!”\n\n“Eh, we’ll deal with it when the time comes. Don’t worry about it.”\nRyoma responded casually with a laid-back smile.\n{player_name} couldn’t help but feel a pang of confusion.\n“Wait... isn’t this guy supposed to be more... extraordinary?”\n\nThe Ryoma Sakamoto described in modern times is a charismatic trailblazer, a visionary genius. But the man before you seemed more like an affable older brother.\n\nNagi whispered calmly,\n“That’s natural. The modern image of Ryoma has been heavily romanticized by novels and dramas. In truth, he was more of a skilled negotiator than a dramatic hero—pragmatic and business-savvy.”\n\nLater, a crew member came running, breathless.\n“Trouble! The Irohamaru has been in a collision!”\n\nThe others grew tense, but Ryoma remained surprisingly calm.\n“If we don’t have the money to fix it, we’ll find another way. If it’s broken, we’ll replace it. No big deal.”\n\nAt that moment, Nagi’s tone sharpened.\n“This isn’t right… Normally, this is the turning point where Ryoma becomes the negotiator in the Irohamaru Incident—the very event that leads to Japan’s first maritime compensation case. But now… something’s changed. Your presence here has altered Ryoma’s decision.”\n\nSimulated futures quickly appeared on your smartphone screen.\n“If things continue like this, Ryoma Sakamoto may vanish from history. The heroic legend that defines modern Japan could be erased. A future without heroes is taking shape.”\n\nYour heart stirred with unease. Could your arrival here really be rewriting Japan’s future? Could you be the one to erase a legend?\n\nNagi’s voice was quiet—but heavy.\n“Normally, interfering with the past is forbidden. But in this case… an exception must be made. Your choices now will shape Ryoma Sakamoto’s future.”\n\nA powerful sense of duty surged from deep within.\n“This can’t go on. I have to ensure Ryoma becomes the hero history needs—”\n\nThus began your hidden mission.",

Let’s see what you’ve got.”\n\nFollowing Nagi’s lead, you casually offered a “prediction” based on future events.\n\n“In a few days, a merchant ship will dock at the western port, and you’ll make a major deal with him.

You’re an interesting one.”\n\nThe moment passed as light-hearted banter.\n\n──But just a few days later...\n\nA merchant ship arrived at the western port. A major deal was struck.

Nagi’s voice echoed calmly in their ear.\n\n“{player_name}, would you like me to explain how Ryoma Sakamoto is remembered in the future?”\n\nOn the screen, Nagi’s expression appeared more serious than usual.\n\n—\n\n\uD83E\uDDE0 Nagi’s Future Explanation:\n\n“In modern times, Ryoma Sakamoto is widely known as the hero who changed Japan. The following five events are considered the pillars of his legendary status.”\n\nNagi listed them one by one:\n\n1\uFE0F⃣ Mediator of the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance\n\n“He is famous for brokering the alliance between the once-hostile Satsuma and Choshu domains.”\n\n2\uFE0F⃣ Architect Behind the Return of Power to the Emperor\n\n“He played a key behind-the-scenes role in getting the Tokugawa Shogunate to return political power to the Emperor.”\n\n3\uFE0F⃣ The Visionary of the ‘Senchu Hassaku’\n\n“He’s known for drafting a forward-thinking national policy aboard a ship—an outline known as the ‘Senchu Hassaku.’”\n\n4\uFE0F⃣ Founder of the Kaientai Trading Fleet\n\n“He also created the Kaientai, considered Japan’s first commercial trading company, showcasing his entrepreneurial spirit.”\n\n5\uFE0F⃣ His Tragic Assassination (The Omiya Incident)\n\n“His dramatic death by assassination helped solidify his legendary status as a national hero.”\n\n“As for why Ryoma was assassinated—this remains a topic of debate even today. However, a leading theory suggests that he made many enemies by leading Japan into a new era, and he was caught in the crossfire of high-stakes political struggles.”\n\nNagi spoke carefully.\n\n“Even the identity of the assassins has never been definitively determined. There are many theories—Tokugawa loyalists, radical samurai from rival domains, merchant feuds… The truth remains buried in darkness.”\n\nThen Nagi gave a stern warning:\n\n“Technically, you could investigate the truth during your time here… But I strongly advise against it. It would be extremely dangerous.”\n\nNagi looked straight at {player_name}.\n\n“Also, much of Ryoma’s legend has been dramatized in novels and TV shows. The actual historical record is surprisingly thin.”\n\nThe reality of that hit hard.\n\n“Still, for modern Japan, Ryoma Sakamoto is a necessary hero. Your mission is to ensure that the events tied to his legend unfold properly. The course of history now depends on your choices.”\n\nNagi paused, then smiled gently.\n\n“Since we're here, how about a little unexpected quiz about Ryoma Sakamoto? A brief mental break can be useful. But be careful—answering incorrectly will cost you LP.”\n\n“Here’s the question: What is said to be one of Ryoma’s personal favorites?”",

      "story": "One day, Nagi spoke quietly.\n\n“A major mission is approaching—one that will restore the flow of history to its proper course. Its name... is the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance.”\n\nThe familiar name made {player_name} instinctively look up.\n\nNagi continued with a calm, explanatory tone.\n\n“At the time, the Satsuma and Choshu domains were the wealthiest and most militarily powerful in Japan. If they joined forces, even the mighty Tokugawa shogunate couldn’t stand against them. That’s why—if they come together here, the era of the shogunate will end.”\n\nThe message was simple—but heavy.\n\n“In modern Japan, Ryoma Sakamoto is widely celebrated as the hero who brokered the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance.”\n\n——But that evening...\n\nAs Kaientai members drank together, a few began grumbling.\n\n“Those Satsuma guys are still stubborn. This is no time to be bickering with Choshu…”\n\n“They’re both too damn proud. No one can break the deadlock. Honestly, it’s hopeless.”\n\nRyoma simply smiled and sipped his drink as he listened to the banter. Then, he muttered idly:\n\n“Well, not that it’s got anything to do with me… but if I were to step in and bring those two together… what would happen, I wonder?”\n\nIt was clearly just a drunken musing—but at that moment, Nagi’s voice sharpened:\n\n“{player_name}, that one line is a historic turning point. According to recent research, Ryoma wasn’t deeply involved in the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance at all. But in today’s world, he’s seen as the man who made it happen—an image deeply ingrained in Japan’s national identity.”\n\nNagi’s voice grew more serious.\n\n“If you don’t act now, Ryoma’s name may vanish from Japan’s future entirely. This is your moment—the moment when you must rewrite history from behind the scenes.”\n\nRyoma, perhaps a little tipsy, looked over and chuckled.\n\n“So, what do you think? Me bringing those two together—pretty laughable, huh?”\n\nNagi whispered urgently:\n\n“Now is the time for a guiding lie—for the sake of the future. This is where your real mission begins.”\n\nWith resolve building in their heart, {player_name} gave their answer.",

His image as a future hero remains unstable.”\n\nBut Nagi continued:\n\n“Still, this isn’t over. With some strategic nudging, we can still influence him.”\n\nIn the days that followed, {player_name} and Nagi carefully devised a plan. They began subtly influencing Ryoma’s allies and local merchants—planting the idea of the alliance.\n\nGradually, Ryoma began to change.\n\n“...Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if those two teamed up.”\n\nNagi spoke softly, almost with a smile:\n\n“There’s still a faint link to the future.

It appears nowhere in textbooks, statues, or novels. A Japan without heroes—one that has lost its symbol of hope and self-determination.”\n\nThere was a quiet sadness in Nagi’s voice.\n\n“Japan is now a country that no longer remembers Ryoma Sakamoto. The courage and confidence he once inspired... are lost to history.”\n\nAnd quietly, the screen faded to black.",

In order to shift political power, the shogunate must willingly step down.\nTaisei Hōkan is an essential step toward creating a new Japan.” —Nagi\n\nNagi’s message continued:\n“The key player here is the Tosa Domain.\nUnlike the pro-revolutionary Satsuma and Choshu, Tosa maintains a neutral stance.\nThis makes it one of the few domains capable of communicating directly with the shogunate.” —Nagi\n\n“In actual history, Tosa’s efforts were a major factor in the realization of Taisei Hōkan.\nIf Ryoma can move Tosa, the shogunate will follow—it’s only a matter of time.” —Nagi\n\nWhile looking at the screen, {player_name} spoke gently to Ryoma:\n“Tosa might be the key to shaping this country’s future.\nIf they take action, the shogunate is likely to follow.”\n\nRyoma nodded deeply, then asked with urgency:\n“But how do we move Tosa?”\n\nA new message appeared on the smartphone:\n“The rifles you helped purchase in Nagasaki have now become crucial.\nTosa is wary of Satsuma and Choshu’s growing military strength.\nIf news of those rifle deals reaches them, Tosa will have no choice but to act.” —Nagi\n\n“This is the final trump card for moving the government—without bloodshed.” —Nagi\n\n{player_name} closed the screen quietly and advised Ryoma in a calm voice.\n\n“What Tosa fears most is war.\nIf they sense that Satsuma and Choshu are serious about taking up arms,\nthey’ll be forced to move.\nThe rifle deal in Nagasaki might be the perfect trigger.”\n\nRyoma’s eyes widened, then he grinned.\n\n“I never thought that trade back then would turn out to be so useful...\nTo win without fighting—that’s exactly it.\nAlright, let’s make sure Tosa understands how serious Satsuma and Choshu are.\nWith that, the path to moving the shogunate is clear.”\n\nAnother message popped up from Nagi.\n\n“Tosa will soon take action.\nNext, it’s time to negotiate directly with the shogunate.\nBut before that—let’s rehearse.” —Nagi\n\nRyoma clenched his fist and declared with determination:\n“We can’t afford to fail in the actual negotiation.\nThat’s why I need to train now.\nHelp sharpen my negotiation skills!”",

It’s like a script for a fortune teller.”\n\n{player_name} nodded quietly.\n“This is a ‘future negotiation rehearsal’ made just for you.\nLet’s try practicing with these lines.”\n\nThough skeptical at first, Ryoma began flipping through the pages like a paper playbook.\n\n“I see... so that’s how I should open the conversation.\nHmm, this part’s tougher than I thought...”\n\nSoon, he was fully focused, reciting the lines like a stage actor.\nWith passion and repetition, he practiced each possible line of dialogue.\n\n“Hah!
